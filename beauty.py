Are you going for a natural, everyday look or something more bold and glamorous? \n\nI just love how lip tint gives that natural flush of color, and gloss adds that beautiful shine.  \n\nTo complete your look,  I would suggest adding a  [red velvet matte lipstick ]\n\nFor example:\n* **If they want a natural look:**  A tinted lip balm would be perfect for adding just a touch of color and hydration.  \n* **If they want a bold look:** A  highlighter to accentuate your cheekbones and brow bone would really make your look pop.\n\nLet me know what you think! I'm happy to help you find the perfect products to complete your beauty routine. \n",

This will give you everything you need for a natural or glamorous look, depending on your mood.  \n\n* **For a natural look:**  I recommend our **[brand name]  \"Barely There\" Palette** -  It has soft, neutral shades that are perfect for everyday wear.  \n* **For a glamorous look:** I would suggest our **[brand name] \"Glow On\" Palette** -  It has beautiful shimmery shades that will make your eyes pop and your skin glow.\n\nNow, to take your lips to the next level, I recommend a **lip liner** to define your lips and prevent your lip color from bleeding. \n\n* **For a natural look:**  A  **[brand name] \"Nude Lip Liner\"** will create a soft, natural outline. \n* **For a glamorous look:**  A  **[brand name] \"Deep Plum Lip Liner\"** will give you a dramatic, bold look.\n\nFinally, don't forget about the **eyes**.  A good mascara can make all the difference.  \n\n* **For a natural look:**  Our **[brand name] \"Long Lash\" Mascara** will add length and volume without looking too dramatic.  \n* **For a glamorous look:**  Our **[brand name] \"Voluminous Black\" Mascara** will give you bold, dramatic lashes.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful! If you have any other questions or want to explore other options, please don't hesitate to ask!  I'm here to help you find the perfect products to complete your look. üòä\n",
